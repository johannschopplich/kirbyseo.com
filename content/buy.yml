  items:
    - label: How does the licensing work?
      content: The license allows you to use the plugin on as many Kirby projects as you want, as long as you are the owner of all the sites. Please refer to the [license agreement](/license) for more details.
    - label: What do I get with my purchase?
      content: After your purchase, you will receive an email with a download link to a ZIP file containing the plugin. To install the plugin into your Kirby project, follow the instructions in the [documentation](/docs/get-started). We are currently working on Composer support.
    - label: What if the SEO report is incorrect?
      content: We don't guarantee that the SEO checks are 100% accurate. Some assessments are based on the [`yoastseo`](/docs/guide/assessments) JavaScript package. We are not responsible for any incorrect audits provided by it. However, we are constantly adding new assessments, built by us, to improve the accuracy of the SEO checks. Please test the plugin in the [playground](/playground) before purchasing.

    - label: What does “Unlimited minor & patch updates” include?
      content: We add new features and improvements to Kirby SEO Audit as we get ideas and feedback. You will receive these updates for the major version you have purchased. When a new major version is released, you will be able to upgrade to that version at a generous discount. A typical major version is intended to be released alongside a new major Kirby version.
    - label: How do I receive updates for the plugin?
