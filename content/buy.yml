    - label: What if the SEO report is incorrect?
      content: We don't guarantee that the SEO checks are 100% accurate. Some assessments are based on the [`yoastseo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yoastseo) JavaScript package. We are not responsible for any incorrect audits provided by it. However, we are constantly improving the plugin by adding new assessments. Please test the plugin in the [playground](/playground) before purchasing.
