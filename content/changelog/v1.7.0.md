Prior to v1.7, the plugin was published on a private Composer repository. It is now available on Packagist and can be installed without authentication. Your license key remains the same and is still required in production environments. To migrate your license key to the new location, follow these steps:

- Remove the `repo.kirby.tools` private repository configuration from your `composer.json` file and run `composer update` to install the latest version of the plugin.
- Open a Panel page that contains the SEO Audit section.
- Your license key is **automatically migrated** from the `auth.json` file in your root directory to the new location in the `/site/config/.kirby-tools-licenses` file.
- Update your `.gitignore` file to exclude the new license file.

You can now delete the `auth.json` file from the root directory.
