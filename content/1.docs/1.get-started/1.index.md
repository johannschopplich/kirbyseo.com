## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

#### Composer

::callout{icon="i-ri-question-line"}
We are currently working on a private Composer repository that will allow you to install the plugin using Composer. Please bear with us while we work on this feature. In the meantime, you can install the plugin manually. 🙆‍♂️

#### Download

After your purchase, you will receive a download link for the plugin. Download the ZIP file and extract it to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-seo-audit/
│  ├─ index.js
│  ├─ index.php
│  ├─ … other plugin files
```

### Step 2: Blueprint Setup

To display the SEO audit section in the Kirby Panel, add a section of type `seo-audit` to any page blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
```

You don't have to configure anything else! Open your Kirby Panel and you should see the new SEO audit section:

Click the **Analyze** button to perform SEO checks on the current page. The report will evaluate the SEO quality of the page and provide actionable insights to improve it.
