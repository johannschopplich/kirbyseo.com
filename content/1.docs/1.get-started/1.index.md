## Quick Start

1. After your purchase, you will receive a download link for the plugin. Download the ZIP file and extract it to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-seo-audit/
│  ├─ index.js
│  ├─ index.php
│  ├─ … other plugin files
```

2. To display the SEO audit section in the Kirby Panel, add a section of type `seo-audit` to any page blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
```

You don't have to configure anything else! Open your Kirby Panel and you should see the new SEO audit section:

::preview{src="/img/seo-audit-section.png"}
::

Click the **Analyze** button to perform SEO checks on the current page. The report will evaluate the SEO quality of the page and provide actionable insights to improve it.
