## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

After your purchase, you will receive a download link for the plugin. Download the ZIP file and extract it to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-seo-audit/
│  ├─ index.js
│  ├─ index.php
│  ├─ … other plugin files
```

Why not install the plugin using Composer? Honestly, because a private Composer repository is more expensive than what we charge for the plugin. If you have an idea how to set up a Composer package without breaking the bank, [feel free to reach out](/contact).

### Step 2: Blueprint Setup

To display the SEO audit section in the Kirby Panel, add a section of type `seo-audit` to any page blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  seoAudit:
    type: seo-audit
```

You don't have to configure anything else! Open your Kirby Panel and you should see the new SEO audit section:

Click the **Analyze** button to perform SEO checks on the current page. The report will evaluate the SEO quality of the page and provide actionable insights to improve it.
