## Overview

Currently, Kirby SEO Audit comes with 30 different SEO checks that can be included in the SEO report:

- 27 assessments are based on the [`yoastseo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yoastseo) JavaScript package, which is part of the official [Yoast SEO for WordPress](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) plugin.
- 3 assessments are provided by the Kirby SEO Audit plugin.

We are working on adding more assessments that don't rely on Yoast SEO's analysis. If you have any suggestions what to add, please [let us know](/contact).

### Kirby SEO Audit Assessments

The following assessments are provided by the Kirby SEO Audit plugin:

- **Alt attribute**: Checks whether all images have an `alt` attribute.
- **Single H1**: Checks whether the content contains a H1 heading.
- **Heading structure order**: Checks whether the headings (H1 to H6) follow a proper sequential order.

- Subheading Distribution Too Long
- Text Presence

## Custom Reports

By default, all assessments are enabled. Pick which assessments to include in the SEO report by adding a `assessments` field to the page's options in the blueprint:

```yaml [sections/seo-insights.yml]
type: seo-insights
assessments:
  - PageTitleWidth
  - TextImages
  - TextLength
```

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
Assessment names are case-sensitive and must be written in pascal case. For example, the _Meta Description Length_ assessment is written as `MetaDescriptionLength`.

## Keyword/Keyphrase Field

If no [`keyphraseField`](/docs/get-started/configuration#keyphrasefield) is defined or the field is empty, all keyphrase assessments will be skipped, unless you explicitly enable them in the `assessments` property.

The following assessments require a keyphrase to be defined:

- Function Words in Keyphrase
- Introduction Keyword
- Keyphrase Length
- Keyword Density
- Keyphrase Distribution
- Meta Description Keyword
- Subheadings Keyword
- Title Keyword
- Url Keyword
