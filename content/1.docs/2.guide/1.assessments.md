You can choose from 27 different SEO assessments that can be included in the SEO report. These assessments are based on the analysis of the HTML content of a given page by [`yoastseo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yoastseo) JavaScript package, which is part of the official [Yoast SEO for WordPress](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) plugin.

Kirby SEO Audit uses Yoast SEO's default metrics and provides its own methods for calculating title length, for example. The following scores are available:

- Flesch Reading Ease
- Paragraph Too Long
- Passive Voice
- Sentence Beginnings
- Sentence Length in Description
- Sentence Length in Text
- Subheading Distribution Too Long
- Text Presence
- Transition Words
- Word Complexity
- Function Words in Keyphrase
- Internal Links
- Introduction Keyword
- Keyphrase Length
- Keyword Density
- Keyword Stop Words
- Keyphrase Distribution
- Meta Description Keyword
- Meta Description Length
- Outbound Links
- Page Title Width
- Subheadings Keyword
- Text Competing Links
- Text Images
- Text Length
- Title Keyword
- Url Keyword

If you were to include all assessments in the SEO report, the blueprint would look like this:

```yaml [sections/seo-insights.yml]
type: seo-insights
assessments:
  - FleschReadingEase
  - ParagraphTooLong
  - PassiveVoice
  - SentenceBeginnings
  - SentenceLengthInDescription
  - SentenceLengthInText
  - SubheadingDistributionTooLong
  - TextPresence
  - TransitionWords
  - WordComplexity
  - FunctionWordsInKeyphrase
  - InternalLinks
  - IntroductionKeyword
  - KeyphraseLength
  - KeywordDensity
  - KeywordStopWords
  - KeyphraseDistribution
  - MetaDescriptionKeyword
  - MetaDescriptionLength
  - OutboundLinks
  - PageTitleWidth
  - SubheadingsKeyword
  - TextCompetingLinks
  - TextImages
  - TextLength
  - TitleKeyword
  - UrlKeyword
```

## Custom Report

Pick which assessments to include in the SEO report by adding a `assessments` field to the page's options in the blueprint:

```yaml [sections/seo-insights.yml]
type: seo-insights
assessments:
  - PageTitleWidth
  - TextImages
  - TextLength
```

## Keyword/Keyphrase Field

If no [`keyphraseField`](/docs/get-started/configuration#keyphrasefield) is defined or the field is empty, all keyphrase assessments will be skipped, unless you explicitly enable them in the `assessments` property.

The following assessments require a keyphrase to be defined:

- Function Words in Keyphrase
- Introduction Keyword
- Keyphrase Length
- Keyword Density
- Keyphrase Distribution
- Meta Description Keyword
- Subheadings Keyword
- Title Keyword
- Url Keyword
